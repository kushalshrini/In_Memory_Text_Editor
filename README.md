# In_Memory_Text_Editor
The in memory text editor with the GUI interface is able to store the text entered in the console window and print it back onto the console window in the format it was entered.
#**We have used the following operations :**
 Insertion − Adds an element at the current position of the cursor.
 Display − Displays the complete list.
 Delete − Deletes an element at the current position of the cursor.
1. When the user presses the backspace key the node pointed to by the cursor is removed 
and the cursor moves one step back.
2. The user should be able to use the direction keys to move the cursor within the text 
without editing the text. Note: vertical direction keys will move cursor within lines.
3. The user should be able to insert a new line wherever she wishes in text. Note that in this 
project the newline is taken as a series of spaces till the current line of the window is 
filled.
